# What I Learned from Enterprise Cybersecurity Exposure

Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to spend time at Tesco's Head Office, initially for a Software Development placement. After performing well, I was invited back for a second week—this time focusing on Cyber Security.

This experience fundamentally changed how I think about security.

## The Scale of Enterprise Security

The first thing that struck me was the sheer scale. Protecting a large organisation isn't just about firewalls and antivirus—it's a complex ecosystem of people, processes, and technology working together.

I observed how security teams handle:
- **Threat detection** at massive scale, processing millions of events
- **Incident response** procedures that are rehearsed and refined
- **Security architecture** decisions that balance security with business needs
- **Compliance** requirements that shape how data is handled

## Key Takeaways

### Security is a Team Sport
No single person or tool can secure an organisation. It requires coordination across teams—security analysts, developers, network engineers, and business stakeholders all play a role.

### Process Matters as Much as Technology
Having the best tools means nothing without proper processes. I saw how documented procedures, runbooks, and clear escalation paths make the difference between chaos and controlled response during incidents.

### The Attacker's Perspective
Understanding how attackers think is crucial. The security team constantly considers: "How would someone try to break this?" This adversarial mindset informs defensive decisions.

### Communication is Critical
Technical skills alone aren't enough. Security professionals need to communicate risks to non-technical stakeholders, write clear reports, and collaborate effectively. The best security advice is useless if no one understands it.

## How It Shaped My Goals

This placement reinforced my interest in pursuing cybersecurity as a career. But more importantly, it gave me context for my learning. Now when I study a concept or build something in my home lab, I can connect it to real-world applications I've seen.

I'm now focused on:
- Building a strong foundation in networking and systems administration
- Understanding both offensive and defensive security
- Developing communication skills alongside technical abilities
- Working towards a degree apprenticeship in financial services where security is paramount

## Advice for Others

If you're interested in cybersecurity, seek out work experience opportunities. Even a short placement provides invaluable insight into how security works in practice. Theoretical knowledge is important, but seeing how it's applied in a corporate environment is transformative.

The professionals I met were generous with their time and advice. The security community, in my experience, is welcoming to newcomers who show genuine interest and willingness to learn.
