This means all my internal services get proper HTTPS certificates.\n\n### Cloud-Hosted VPS\nNot everything runs locally. I have cloud instances on Oracle Cloud's free tier for services that need to be publicly accessible or require more resources than my local hardware can provide.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nBuilding this lab has taught me more than any course could:\n\n1. **Documentation matters** — I've learned to document everything.

It acts as a DNS sinkhole, blocking ads and trackers at the network level—before they even reach your devices.\n\n## Why DNS-Level Blocking?\n\nBrowser-based ad blockers only work in that specific browser. Pi-hole blocks requests at the DNS level, which means:\n\n- **Every device benefits** — Phones, tablets, smart TVs, IoT devices\n- **No software to install** — Just point your DNS to Pi-hole\n- **Better performance** — Blocked requests never load, saving bandwidth\n- **Privacy improvement** — Tracking domains are blocked network-wide\n\n## My Setup\n\nI run Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi 3, the same device that hosts my Tailscale endpoint. It's a perfect use case for a Pi—low power consumption but more than capable of handling DNS queries for a home network.\n\n### Installation\n\nPi-hole installation is straightforward:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash\n```\n\nThe installer walks you through the configuration, including:\n- Choosing an upstream DNS provider (I use Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1)\n- Selecting blocklists\n- Enabling the web interface\n\n### Local DNS Records\n\nOne feature I use heavily is local DNS. Instead of remembering IP addresses, I can access my services by name:\n\n- `pi.local` → 192.168.1.100 (the Pi itself)\n- `nas.local` → 192.168.1.50 (network storage)\n- `printer.local` → 192.168.1.75\n\nThis makes accessing local services much more convenient and feels more professional.\n\n## The Numbers\n\nAfter running Pi-hole for several months, the stats are impressive:\n\n- Around 15-20% of DNS queries are blocked\n- Thousands of ads and trackers stopped daily\n- Noticeable improvement in page load times on ad-heavy sites\n\nThe web dashboard shows exactly what's being blocked and by which device—useful for troubleshooting if something breaks.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nSometimes legitimate services break because a required domain is on a blocklist. Pi-hole makes it easy to whitelist domains:\n\n1. Check the query log to find the blocked domain\n2. Add it to the whitelist\n3. Flush the DNS cache on affected devices\n\nI maintain a small whitelist for services that need specific domains unblocked.\n\n## Advanced: Running Unbound\n\nFor extra privacy, I've also experimented with running Unbound as a recursive DNS resolver. Instead of forwarding queries to Cloudflare or Google, Unbound resolves domains directly by querying root nameservers.\n\nThis adds a layer of privacy since no single upstream provider sees all your DNS queries.\n\n## Integration with Tailscale\n\nBecause Pi-hole runs alongside Tailscale on my Pi, I can use it as my DNS server even when I'm away from home. This means I get ad blocking on my phone whether I'm on my home WiFi or using mobile data through the VPN.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPi-hole is one of those projects where the effort-to-benefit ratio is excellent. A few hours of setup gives you network-wide ad blocking, local DNS, and a dashboard full of interesting data about your network traffic.\n\nIf you have a spare Raspberry Pi or any always-on Linux device, I'd highly recommend setting up Pi-hole.","src/content/blog/pihole-dns-filtering.md","a7aad34141e7a373",{html:130,metadata:131},"<h1 id=\"network-wide-ad-blocking-with-pi-hole\">Network-Wide Ad Blocking with Pi-hole</h1>\n<p>Pi-hole has become one of the most essential services in my home lab.

I wanted to connect to my local devices from anywhere—school, travelling, wherever—as if I was on my home network. Tailscale made this surprisingly easy.\n\n## Why Tailscale?\n\nTraditional VPNs can be complex to set up and maintain. You need to deal with port forwarding, dynamic DNS, certificate management, and firewall rules. Tailscale simplifies all of this by creating a mesh network between your devices.\n\nKey benefits:\n- **No port forwarding required** — Works through NAT without exposing ports\n- **Zero-config encryption** — WireGuard-based, encrypted by default\n- **Cross-platform** — Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android\n- **Easy to set up** — Literally minutes to get running\n\n## My Setup\n\nI run Tailscale on my Raspberry Pi 3, which acts as an always-on endpoint in my home network.

Twingate provides this, and it complements my existing setup nicely.\n\n## What is Zero Trust?\n\nThe traditional security model is \"castle and moat\"—once you're inside the network, you're trusted. Zero trust flips this: **never trust, always verify**. Every access request is authenticated and authorised, regardless of where it comes from.\n\nThis is increasingly how enterprises approach security, and I wanted hands-on experience with the concept.\n\n## Why Twingate?\n\nTwingate provides secure remote access without a traditional VPN:\n\n- **Zero trust architecture** — Resources are only accessible after device and user authentication\n- **No port forwarding** — My Pi stays hidden from the public internet\n- **Split tunnelling** — Only private traffic goes through Twingate; everything else stays local\n- **Fine-grained access control** — I can specify exactly who can access what\n\n## My Setup\n\nI run Twingate on my Raspberry Pi 3 alongside Pi-hole and Tailscale. Each serves a different purpose:\n\n| Service | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Pi-hole** | DNS filtering and ad blocking |\n| **Tailscale** | Full mesh VPN for device connectivity |\n| **Twingate** | Zero-trust access to specific applications |\n\n### Deploying the Connector\n\nTwingate uses a \"connector\" that runs inside your network. I deployed it using Docker:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d \\\n  --restart unless-stopped \\\n  --name twingate-connector \\\n  --network host \\\n  -e TWINGATE_NETWORK=\"your-network\" \\\n  -e TWINGATE_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"your-access-token\" \\\n  -e TWINGATE_REFRESH_TOKEN=\"your-refresh-token\" \\\n  -e TWINGATE_LABEL=\"raspberrypi\" \\\n  twingate/connector:latest\n```\n\n### Defining Resources\n\nIn Twingate's admin console, I defined the private resources I want to access:\n\n- Internal dashboards (Pi-hole admin, router config)\n- Development servers\n- Local web apps I'm testing\n\nEach resource can have specific access policies—who can access it, from which devices, under what conditions.\n\n### Client Setup\n\nOn my iPhone and laptop, I installed the Twingate client and logged in. Now I can access defined resources from anywhere, and the connection is authenticated every time.\n\n## How It Differs from Tailscale\n\nYou might wonder: why use both Tailscale and Twingate?\n\n**Tailscale** gives me a mesh network—all my devices can talk to each other directly. It's like extending my LAN across the internet. Great for SSH access, file sharing, and general connectivity.\n\n**Twingate** is more restrictive by design. It's about accessing specific resources with explicit permissions. I use it for services where I want extra assurance that access is controlled.\n\nIn practice:\n- I use Tailscale for everyday remote access\n- I use Twingate when I want to test zero-trust patterns or access sensitive admin panels\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Zero Trust Requires Planning\nYou need to think carefully about what resources exist and who should access them. This planning exercise itself was valuable—it forced me to inventory my services.\n\n### The UX is Different\nWith a traditional VPN, you \"connect\" and then have full access. With zero trust, you access specific resources as needed. It's more seamless in some ways, more restrictive in others.\n\n### Defense in Depth\nRunning multiple access solutions isn't redundant—it's defense in depth. If one solution has a vulnerability, the other provides a fallback.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZero trust is the direction enterprise security is moving. Having hands-on experience with tools like Twingate gives me practical understanding of these concepts, not just theoretical knowledge.\n\nIf you're already running Tailscale or a traditional VPN, consider experimenting with zero-trust access.

Some services need to be publicly accessible or require more resources than my Raspberry Pi can provide. That's where Oracle Cloud's free tier comes in.\n\n## Why Oracle Cloud?\n\nOracle's Always Free tier is genuinely generous:\n\n- **4 vCPU + 24 GB RAM** (Ampere A1 ARM instances)\n- **200 GB block storage**\n- **Public IPv4 + IPv6**\n- **No time limit** — It's actually free forever, not a trial\n\nThis is enough to run real workloads, not just toy projects.\n\n## What I Host\n\nOn my Oracle Cloud instance, I run:\n\n### Pterodactyl Panel\nA game server management panel for hosting and managing Minecraft servers. It provides a web interface for server administration without needing SSH access for routine tasks.\n\n### Supporting Services\n- **MariaDB** — Database for Pterodactyl\n- **Redis** — Caching layer\n- **Wings Daemon** — Pterodactyl's server management daemon (runs in Docker)\n\n### Other Docker Services\n- **Uptime Kuma** — Self-hosted monitoring for all my services\n- **Portainer** — Visual Docker management\n\n### Traefik Reverse Proxy\nAll services sit behind Traefik, which handles:\n- Routing requests to the correct container\n- Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt\n- Basic security headers\n\n## Initial Setup\n\n### Creating the Instance\n\n1. Sign up for Oracle Cloud (requires a credit card but won't be charged for free tier)\n2. Create an Ampere A1 instance with Ubuntu 22.04\n3. Configure security lists to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic\n4. Set up SSH access\n\n### Basic Hardening\n\nBefore deploying services, I secured the instance:\n\n```bash\n# Update system\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n# Set up UFW firewall\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nsudo ufw allow http\nsudo ufw allow https\nsudo ufw enable\n\n# Install fail2ban for brute force protection\nsudo apt install fail2ban\n```\n\n### Docker Setup\n\nDocker makes deploying services reproducible and isolated:\n\n```bash\n# Install Docker\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n\n# Install Docker Compose\nsudo apt install docker-compose-plugin\n\n# Add user to docker group\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\n## DNS and HTTPS\n\nI use Cloudflare to manage DNS:\n- A records point to Oracle's public IP\n- Orange cloud (proxy) enabled for DDoS protection and HTTPS\n\nTraefik automatically obtains Let's Encrypt certificates, so all services get proper HTTPS.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### ARM Architecture\nOracle's free instances use ARM (aarch64), not x86. Most Docker images support ARM now, but occasionally you'll need to find ARM-compatible alternatives or build your own images.\n\n### Instance Stability\nOracle occasionally reclaims resources from idle instances. I run a lightweight cron job to keep the instance active, and all services are configured to restart automatically.\n\n### Network Considerations\nFree tier instances have limited network throughput. For my use case (game servers and dashboards), it's plenty. But if you're planning to serve lots of traffic, keep this in mind.\n\n## Cost\n\nTotal monthly cost: **£0**\n\nSeriously. I've been running this setup for months without spending anything. The free tier covers everything I need.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOracle Cloud's free tier is an incredible resource for learning and hosting real services. Combined with Docker and Cloudflare, you can run a professional setup without any hosting costs.\n\nIf you're looking to expand beyond your home lab or need publicly accessible services, I highly recommend exploring Oracle Cloud's free tier.","src/content/blog/cloud-hosting-oracle-free-tier.md","055f4d0e18a946cf",{html:276,metadata:277},"<h1 id=\"free-cloud-hosting-with-oracle-cloud\">Free Cloud Hosting with Oracle Cloud</h1>\n<p>Not everything in my infrastructure runs locally.

Most Docker images support ARM now, but occasionally you’ll need to find ARM-compatible alternatives or build your own images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"instance-stability\">Instance Stability</h3>\n<p>Oracle occasionally reclaims resources from idle instances. I run a lightweight cron job to keep the instance active, and all services are configured to restart automatically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"network-considerations\">Network Considerations</h3>\n<p>Free tier instances have limited network throughput. For my use case (game servers and dashboards), it’s plenty. But if you’re planning to serve lots of traffic, keep this in mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Cost</h2>\n<p>Total monthly cost: <strong>£0</strong></p>\n<p>Seriously. I’ve been running this setup for months without spending anything. The free tier covers everything I need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Oracle Cloud’s free tier is an incredible resource for learning and hosting real services. Combined with Docker and Cloudflare, you can run a professional setup without any hosting costs.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to expand beyond your home lab or need publicly accessible services, I highly recommend exploring Oracle Cloud’s free tier.</p>",{headings:278,localImagePaths:328,remoteImagePaths:329,frontmatter:330,imagePaths:333},[279,281,284,287,290,293,296,299,302,305,308,311,314,315,318,321,324,327],{depth:30,slug:280,text:267},"free-cloud-hosting-with-oracle-cloud",{depth:33,slug:282,text:283},"why-oracle-cloud","Why Oracle Cloud?",{depth:33,slug:285,text:286},"what-i-host","What I Host",{depth:40,slug:288,text:289},"pterodactyl-panel","Pterodactyl Panel",{depth:40,slug:291,text:292},"supporting-services","Supporting Services",{depth:40,slug:294,text:295},"other-docker-services","Other Docker Services",{depth:40,slug:297,text:298},"traefik-reverse-proxy","Traefik Reverse Proxy",{depth:33,slug:300,text:301},"initial-setup","Initial Setup",{depth:40,slug:303,text:304},"creating-the-instance","Creating the Instance",{depth:40,slug:306,text:307},"basic-hardening","Basic Hardening",{depth:40,slug:309,text:310},"docker-setup","Docker Setup",{depth:33,slug:312,text:313},"dns-and-https","DNS and HTTPS",{depth:33,slug:56,text:57},{depth:40,slug:316,text:317},"arm-architecture","ARM Architecture",{depth:40,slug:319,text:320},"instance-stability","Instance Stability",{depth:40,slug:322,text:323},"network-considerations","Network Considerations",{depth:33,slug:325,text:326},"cost","Cost",{depth:33,slug:160,text:161},[],[],{title:267,description:268,pubDate:331,tags:332,draft:21},["Date","2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[271,20],[],"cloud-hosting-oracle-free-tier.md"];
